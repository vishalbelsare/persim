Persim is a Python package for many tools used in analyzing Persistence Diagrams.  It currently includes implementations of most of the popular methods of working with persistence diagrams, including

- Persistence Images
- Persistence Landscapes
- Bottleneck distance
- Modified Gromov--Hausdorff distance
- Sliced Wasserstein Kernel
- Heat Kernel
- Diagram plotting
